\chapter{Optimization}




Many important applied problems involve finding the best way to
accomplish some task. Often this involves finding the maximum or
minimum value of some function: The minimum time to make a certain
journey, the minimum cost for doing a task, the maximum power that can
be generated by a device, and so on. Many of these problems can be
solved by finding the appropriate function and then using techniques
of calculus to find the maximum or the minimum value required.


\section{Maximum and Minimum Values of Curves}

We already know how to find local extrema. We wish to find
\textit{absolute extrema}.

\marginnote{It is common to leave off the word ``absolute'' when
  asking for absolute extrema. Hence a ``maximum'' or a ``minimum''
  refers to an absolute extremum. On the other hand, local extrema are
  always specified as such.}
\begin{definition}\hfil\index{maximum/minimum!absolute}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A point $(x,f(x))$ is an \textbf{absolute maximum} on an interval
  if $f(x)\ge f(z)$ for every $z$ in that interval.
\item A point $(x,f(x))$ is an \textbf{absolute minimum} on an interval if
  $f(x)\le f(z)$ for every $z$ in that interval.
\end{enumerate}
An \textbf{absolute extremum}\index{extremum!absolute} is either an
absolute maximum or an absolute minimum.
\end{definition}

If we are working on an finite closed interval, then we have the
following theorem.

\begin{mainTheorem}[Extreme Value Theorem]\label{theorem:evt}\index{Extreme Value Theorem}
If $f(x)$ is a continuous function for all $x$ in the closed interval
$[a,b]$, then there are points $c$ and $d$ in $[a,b]$, such that
$(c,f(c))$ is an absolute maximum and $(d,f(d))$ is an absolute
minimum on $[a, b]$.
\end{mainTheorem}
In Figure~\ref{figure:extreme-value}, we see a geometric
interpretation of this theorem.

\begin{example} 
Find the (absolute) maximum and minimum values of $f(x)=x^2$ on the
interval $[-2,1]$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To start, write
\[
\ddx x^2 = 2x.
\]
The critical point is at $x=0$. By the Extreme Value Theorem,
Theorem~\ref{theorem:evt}, we must also consider the endpoints of the
closed interval, $x=-2$ and $x=1$. Check
\[
f(-2) = 4, \qquad f(0) = 0, \qquad f(1) = 1.
\]
So on the interval $[-2,1]$, the absolute maximum of $f(x)$ is 4 at
$x=-2$ and the absolute minimum is 0 at $x=0$, see Figure~\ref{figure:evt x^2}.

It is possible that there is no global maximum or minimum. It is
difficult, and not particularly useful, to express a complete procedure for
determining whether this is the case. Generally, the best approach is
to gain enough understanding of the shape of the graph to
decide. 

\begin{example}
Find the (absolute) maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)=
|x-2|$ on the interval $[1,4]$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To start, rewrite $f(x)$ as 
\[
f(x) = \sqrt{(x-2)^2},
\]
now
\[
\ddx f(x) = \frac{2(x-2)}{2\sqrt{(x-2)^2}}= \frac{x-2}{|x-2|}.
\]
The derivative $f'(x)$ is never zero, but $f'(x)$ is undefined at
$x=2$, so we have a critical point at $x=2$. Compute $f(2)=
0$. Checking the endpoints we get $f(1)=1$ and $f(4)=2$. The smallest
of these numbers is $f(2)=0$, which is, therefore, the minimum value
of $f(x)$ on the interval and the maximum is $f(4)=2$, see Figure~\ref{figure:evt |x-2|}.

\begin{warning}
The Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem~\ref{theorem:evt}, requires that
the function in question be \textbf{continuous} on a \textbf{closed}
interval.  For example consider $f(x)=\tan(x)$ on $(-\pi/2,
\pi/2)$. In this case, the function is continuous on $(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$,
but the interval is not closed. Hence, the Extreme Value Theorem
\textbf{does not apply}, see Figure~\ref{figure:NOevt tan}.

Finally, if there are several critical points in the interval, then
the mathematician might want to use the second derivative test,
Theorem~\ref{T:sdt}, to identify if the critical points are local
maxima or minima, rather than simply evaluating the function at these
points. Regardless, it depends on the situation, and we will leave it
up to you---our capable reader.

\section{Basic Optimization Problems}


In this section, we will present several worked examples of
optimization problems. Our method for solving these problems is
essentially the following:


\begin{guidelinesForOptimization}\hfil
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Draw a picture.}] If possible, draw a schematic picture with all the relevant information. 
\item[\textbf{Determine your goal.}] We need identify what needs to be
  optimized.
\item[\textbf{Find constraints.}] What limitations are set on our
  optimization?
\item[\textbf{Solve for a single variable.}] Now you should have a function to optimize.
\item[\textbf{Use calculus to find the extreme values.}] Be sure to check your answer!
\end{itemize}
\end{guidelinesForOptimization}

\begin{example}
Of all rectangles of area $100$ cm$^2$, which has the smallest
perimeter?
\end{example}

\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [penColor,very thick,fill=fill2] (0,0) rectangle (5,4);
\node [penColor] at (2.5,2) {$A=100$ cm$^2$};
\node [right,penColor] at (5,2) {$\frac{100}{x}$ cm};
\node [below,penColor] at (2.5,0) {$x$ cm};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A rectangle with an area of $100$ cm$^2$.}
\label{fig:rect100}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{solution}
First we draw a picture, see Figure~\ref{fig:rect100}.  If $x$ denotes
one of the sides of the rectangle, then the adjacent side must be
$100/x$.


The perimeter of this rectangle is given by
\[
p(x)=2x+2\frac{100}{x}.
\]
We wish to minimize $p(x)$.  Note, not all values of $x$ make sense in
this problem: lengths of sides of rectangles must be positive, so
$x>0$. If $x>0$ then so is $100/x$, so we need no second condition on
$x$.

We next find $p'(x)$ and set it equal to zero. Write
\[
p'(x)=2-200/x^2 = 0.
\]
Solving for $x$ gives us $x=\pm 10$. We are interested only in $x>0$,
so only the value $x=10$ is of interest. Since $p'(x)$ is defined
everywhere on the interval $(0,\infty)$, there are no more critical
values, and there are no endpoints. Is there a local maximum, minimum,
or neither at $x=10$? The second derivative is $p''(x)=400/x^3$, and
$f''(10)>0$, so there is a local minimum. Since there is only one
critical value, this is also the global minimum, so the rectangle with
smallest perimeter is the $10$ cm$\times10$ cm square.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
You want to sell a certain number $n$ of items in order to maximize your
profit.  Market research tells you that if you set the price at \$$1.50$, you
will be able to sell $5000$ items, and for every $10$ cents you lower the price
below \$$1.50$ you will be able to sell another $1000$ items.  Suppose that
your fixed costs (``start-up costs'') total \$$2000$, and the per item cost
of production (``marginal cost'') is \$$0.50$.  Find the price to set per
item and the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also
determine the maximum profit you can get.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization
problem. The revenue for selling $n$ items at $x$ dollars is given by
\[
r(x) = nx
\]
and the cost of producing $n$ items is given by
\[
c(x) = 2000+0.5 n. 
\]
However, from the problem we see that the number of items sold is
itself a function of $x$,
\[
n(x) =5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10
\]
So profit is give by:
\begin{align*}
P(x) &= r(x) - c(x)\\
&= nx - (2000+0.5 n)\\
&= (5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)x - 2000 - 0.5 (5000+1000(1.5-x)/0.10)\\
&=-10000x^2+25000x-12000. 
\end{align*}
We want to know the maximum value of this function when $x$ is between
0 and $1.5$. The derivative is $P'(x)=-20000x+25000$, which is zero
when $x=1.25$. Since $P''(x)=-20000<0$, there must be a local maximum
at $x=1.25$, and since this is the only critical value it must be a
global maximum as well. Alternately, we could compute $P(0)=-12000$,
$P(1.25)=3625$, and $P(1.5)=3000$ and note that $P(1.25)$ is the
maximum of these. Thus the maximum profit is \$$3625$, attained when we
set the price at \$$1.25$ and sell $7500$ items. 
\end{solution}


\begin{example} 
Find the rectangle with largest area that fits inside the graph of the
parabola $y=x^2$ below the line $y=a$, where $a$ is an unspecified
constant value, with the top side of the rectangle on the horizontal
line $y=a$. See Figure~\ref{fig:rectangle parabola}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A plot of the parabola $y=x^2$ along with the line $y=a$ and the rectangle in question.}
\label{fig:rectangle parabola}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{solution}
We want to maximize value of $A(x)$.  The lower right corner of the
rectangle is at $(x,x^2)$, and once this is chosen the rectangle is
completely determined. Then the area is
\[
A(x)=(2x)(a-x^2)=-2x^3+2ax.
\] 
We want the maximum value of $A(x)$ when $x$ is in $[0,\sqrt{a}]$. You
might object to allowing $x=0$ or $x=\sqrt{a}$, since then the
``rectangle'' has either no width or no height, so is not ``really'' a
rectangle. But the problem is somewhat easier if we simply allow such
rectangles, which have zero area as we may then apply the Extreme
Value Theorem, Theorem~\ref{theorem:evt}.

Setting $0=A'(x)=-6x^2+2a$ we find $x=\sqrt{a/3}$ as the only critical
point. Testing this and the two endpoints, we have
$A(0)=A(\sqrt{a})=0$ and $A(\sqrt{a/3})=(4/9)\sqrt{3}a^{3/2}$. Hence,
the maximum area thus occurs when the rectangle has dimensions
$2\sqrt{a/3}\times (2/3)a$.

\end{marginfigure}

\begin{solution}
Let $R$ be the radius of the sphere, and let $r$ and $h$ be the base
radius and height of the cone inside the sphere.  Our goal is to
maximize the volume of the cone: $V_c=\pi r^2h/3$.  The largest $r$
could be is $R$ and the largest $h$ could be is $2R$.

Notice that the function we want to maximize, $\pi r^2h/3$, depends on
\textit{two} variables.  Our next step is to find the relationship and
use it to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, so as
to have a function of only one variable to maximize.  In this problem,
the condition is apparent in the figure, as the upper corner of the
triangle, whose coordinates are $(r,h-R)$, must be on the circle of
radius $R$. Write
\[
r^2 + (h-R)^2=R^2.
\] 
Solving for $r^2$, since $r^2$ is found in the formula for the volume
of the cone, we find 
\[
r^2=R^2-(h-R)^2.
\]  
Substitute this into the formula for the volume of the cone to find

\begin{align*}
 V_{\text{c}}(h)&=\pi(R^2-(h-R)^2)h/3 \\
&=-{\pi\over3}h^3+{2\over3}\pi h^2R
\end{align*}

We want to maximize $V_{\text{c}}(h)$ when $h$ is between 0 and $2R$.  We
solve 
\[
V_{\text{c}}'(h)=-\pi h^2+(4/3)\pi h R=0,
\] 
finding $h=0$ or $h=4R/3$.  We compute
\[
V_{\text{c}}(0)=V_{\text{c}}(2R)=0\qquad\text{and}\qquad V_{\text{c}}(4R/3)=(32/81)\pi R^3.
\] 
The maximum is the latter. Since the volume of the sphere is $(4/3)\pi
R^3$, the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is
\[
\frac{(32/81)\pi R^3}{(4/3)\pi R^3}=\frac{8}{27}\approx 30\%.
\]
\end{solution}






\begin{example}
You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume.  Suppose
that the top and bottom are made of a material that is $N$ times as
expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of
the cylinder.  Find (in terms of $N$) the ratio of height to base radius of
the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the containers.

\caption{A cylinder with radius $r$, height $h$, volume $V$, $c$ for
  the cost per unit area of the lateral side of the cylinder.}
\label{fig:cylinder}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{solution}
First we draw a picture, see Figure~\ref{fig:cylinder}.  Now we can
write an expression for the cost of materials:
\[
  C = 2\pi crh+2\pi r^2Nc.
\]
Since we know that $V=\pi r^2h$, we can use this relationship to
eliminate $h$ (we could eliminate $r$, but it's a little easier if we
eliminate $h$, which appears in only one place in the above formula
for cost).  We find
\begin{align*}
C(r)&=2c\pi r\frac{V}{\pi r^2}+2Nc\pi r^2\\
&=\frac{2cV}{r}+2Nc\pi r^2.
\end{align*}
We want to know the minimum value of this function when $r$ is in
$(0,\infty)$. Setting
\[
C'(r)=-2cV/r^2+4Nc\pi r =0
\]
we find $r=\sqrt[3]{V/(2N\pi)}$.  Since $C''(r)=4cV/r^3+4Nc\pi$ is
  positive when $r$ is positive, there is a local minimum at the
  critical value, and hence a global minimum since there is only one
  critical value.

Finally, since $h=V/(\pi r^2)$, 
\begin{align*}
\frac{h}{r}&=\frac{V}{\pi r^3}\\ 
&=\frac{V}{\pi(V/(2N\pi))}\\ 
&=2N,
\end{align*}
so the minimum cost occurs when the height $h$ is $2N$ times the
radius. If, for example, there is no difference in the cost of
materials, the height is twice the radius.
\end{solution}


\begin{example}\label{exam:sand and road} Suppose you want to reach a point $A$ that is located across the

$w$, which is less than $v$, be your speed on the sand.  Right now you

\caption{A road where one travels at rate $v$, with sand where one
  travels at rate $w$. Where should one turn off of the road to
  minimize total travel time from $D$ to $A$?}
\label{fig:roadsand}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{solution}
Let $x$ be the distance short of $C$ where you turn off, the distance
from $B$ to $C$.  We want to minimize the total travel time.  Recall
that when traveling at constant velocity, time is distance divided by
velocity.

You travel the distance from $D$ to $B$ at speed $v$, and then the
distance from $B$ to $A$ at speed $w$.  The distance from $D$ to $B$
is $a-x$. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from $B$ to $A$
is
\[
\sqrt{x^2+b^2}.
\] 
Hence the total time for the trip is
\[
   T(x)=\frac{a-x}{v}+\frac{\sqrt{x^2+b^2}}{w}.
\]
We want to find the minimum value of $T$ when $x$ is between 0 and
$a$.  As usual we set $T'(x)=0$ and solve for $x$. Write
\[
  T'(x)=-\frac{1}{v}+\frac{x}{w\sqrt{x^2+b^2}} =0.
\]
We find that 
\[
x=\frac{wb}{\sqrt{v^2-w^2}}
\]
Notice that $a$ does not appear in the last expression, but $a$ is not
irrelevant, since we are interested only in critical values that are
in $[0,a]$, and $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ is either in this interval or not.
If it is, we can use the second derivative to test it:
\[
T''(x) = {b^2\over (x^2+b^2)^{3/2}w}.
\]
Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical
point, and so it is a global minimum as well.

If the critical value is not in $[0,a]$ it is larger than $a$. In this
case the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints. We can compute
\begin{align*}
T(0)&={a\over v}+{b\over w} \\
T(a)&={\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\over w} 
\end{align*}
but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct
comparison. If, as is likely in practice, we know the values of $v$,
$w$, $a$, and $b$, then it is easy to determine this. With a little
cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum in general. We have seen that
$T''(x)$ is always positive, so the derivative $T'(x)$ is always increasing.
We know that at $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ the derivative is zero, so for
values of $x$ less than that critical value, the derivative is
negative. This means that $T(0)>T(a)$, so the minimum occurs when $x=a$.

So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from $C$ than
$wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ then you always want to cut across the sand 
when you are a distance $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ from point $C$. If you
start closer than this to $C$, you should cut directly across the sand.
