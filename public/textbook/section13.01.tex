\section{Space Curves}{}{}

We have already seen that a convenient way to describe a line in three
dimensions is to provide a vector that ``points to'' every point on
the line as a parameter $t$ varies, like
$$\langle 1,2,3\rangle+t\langle 1,-2,2\rangle
=\langle 1+t,2-2t,3+2t\rangle.$$
Except that this gives a particularly simple geometric object, there
is nothing special about the individual functions of $t$ that make up
the coordinates of this vector---any vector with a parameter, like
$\langle f(t),g(t),h(t)\rangle$, will describe some curve in three
dimensions as $t$ varies through all possible values. 

\begin{example} Describe the curves
$\langle \cos t,\sin t,0\rangle$,
$\langle \cos t,\sin t,t\rangle$, and
$\langle \cos t,\sin t,2t\rangle$.
\label{exam:helixes}

As $t$ varies, the first two coordinates in all three functions
trace out the points on the unit circle, starting
with $(1,0)$ when $t=0$ and proceeding counter-clockwise around the
circle as $t$ increases. In the first case, the $z$ coordinate is
always 0, so this describes precisely the unit circle in the $x$-$y$
plane. In the second case, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates still describe
a circle, but now 
the $z$ coordinate varies, so that the
height of the curve matches the value of $t$. When $t=\pi$, for
example, the resulting vector is $\langle -1,0,\pi\rangle$. A bit of
thought should convince you that the result is a helix. In the third
vector, the $z$ coordinate varies twice as fast as the parameter $t$,
so we get a stretched out helix. Both are shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:helixes}. On the left is the first helix, shown for
$t$ between 0 and $4\pi$; on the right is the second helix, shown for
$t$ between 0 and $2\pi$. Both start and end at the same point, but
the first helix takes two full ``turns'' to get there, because its $z$
coordinate grows more slowly.
\end{example}

A vector expression of the form $\langle f(t),g(t),h(t)\rangle$ is called
a {\dfont vector function\index{vector!function}}; it is a function from
the real numbers $\R$ to the set of all three-dimensional vectors.
We can alternately think of it as three separate functions, 
$x=f(t)$, $y=g(t)$, and $z=h(t)$, that describe points in space. In
this case we usually refer to the set of equations as {\dfont
parametric equations\index{parametric equations}} for the curve, just
as for a line. While the parameter $t$ in a vector function might
represent any one of a number of physical quantities, or be simply a
``pure number'', it is often convenient and useful to think of $t$ as
representing time. The vector function then tells you where in space
a particular object is at any time.

Vector functions can be difficult to understand, that is, difficult to
picture. When available, computer software can be very helpful. When
working by hand, one useful approach is to consider the
``projections'' of the curve onto the three standard coordinate
planes. We have already done this in part: in
example~\xrefn{exam:helixes} we noted that all three curves project to
a circle in the $x$-$y$ plane, since $\langle \cos t,\sin t\rangle$ is
a two dimensional vector function for the unit circle.

\begin{example} Graph the projections of $\langle \cos t,\sin
t,2t\rangle$ onto the $x$-$z$ plane and the $y$-$z$ plane.
The two dimensional vector function for the
projection onto the $x$-$z$ plane is $\langle \cos t, 2t\rangle$, or in
parametric form, $x=\cos t$, $z=2t$. By eliminating $t$ we get the
equation $x=\cos(z/2)$, the familiar curve shown on the left in
figure~\xrefn{fig:helix projections}. For the projection onto the $y$-$z$ plane, we start
with the vector function $\langle \sin t, 2t\rangle$, which is the
same as $y=\sin t$, $z=2t$. Eliminating $t$ gives $y=\sin(z/2)$, as
shown on the right in figure~\xrefn{fig:helix projections}.
