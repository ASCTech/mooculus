\chapter{Rules for Finding Derivatives}

It is tedious to compute a limit every time we need to know the
derivative of a function. Fortunately, we can develop a small
collection of examples and rules that allow us to compute the
derivative of almost any function we are likely to encounter. Many
functions involve quantities raised to a constant power, such as
polynomials and more complicated combinations like $y=(\sin x)^4$. So
we start by examining powers of a single variable; this gives us a
building block for more complicated examples.
