We have seen how to solve a restricted collection of differential
equations, or more  accurately, how to attempt to solve them---we may
not be able to find the required anti-derivatives. Not surprisingly,
non-linear equations can be even more difficult to solve. Yet much is
known about solutions to some more general equations.

Suppose $\phi(t,y)$ is a function of two variables. A more general
class of first order differential equations has the form $\ds\dot
y=\phi(t,y)$. This is not necessarily a linear first order equation,
since $\phi$ may depend on $y$ in some complicated way; note however
that $\ds\dot y$ appears in a very simple form. Under suitable
conditions on the function $\phi$, it can be shown that every such
differential equation has a solution, and moreover that for each
initial condition the associated initial value problem has exactly one
solution. In practical applications this is obviously a very desirable
property. 

\begin{example} The equation $\ds\dot y=t-y^2$ is a first order non-linear
equation, because $y$ appears to the second power. We will not be able
to solve this equation.
\end{example}

\begin{example} The equation $\ds\dot y=y^2$ is also non-linear, but it is
separable and can be solved by separation of variables.
\end{example}

Not all differential equations that are important in practice can be
solved exactly, so techniques have been developed to approximate
solutions. We describe one such technique, {\dfont Euler's
  Method\index{Euler's Method}}, which is simple though not particularly
useful compared to some more sophisticated techniques.

Suppose we wish to approximate a solution to the initial value problem
$\ds\dot y=\phi(t,y)$, $\ds y(t_0)=y_0$, for $t\ge t_0$. Under
reasonable conditions on $\phi$, we know the solution exists,
represented by a curve in the $t$-$y$ plane; call this solution
$f(t)$. The point $\ds (t_0,y_0)$ is of course on this curve. We also
know the slope of the curve at this point, namely
$\ds\phi(t_0,y_0)$. If we follow the tangent line for a brief
distance, we arrive at a point that should be almost on the graph of
$f(t)$, namely $\ds(t_0+\Delta t, y_0+\phi(t_0,y_0)\Delta t)$; call
this point $\ds(t_1,y_1)$. Now we pretend, in effect, that this point
really is on the graph of $f(t)$, in which case we again know the
slope of the curve through $\ds(t_1,y_1)$, namely
$\ds\phi(t_1,y_1)$. So we can compute a new point,
$\ds(t_2,y_2)=(t_1+\Delta t, y_1+\phi(t_1,y_1)\Delta t)$ that 
is a little farther along, still close to the graph of $f(t)$ but
probably not quite so close as $\ds(t_1,y_1)$. We can continue in this
way, doing a sequence of straightforward calculations, until we have
an approximation $\ds(t_n,y_n)$ for whatever time $\ds t_n$ we need. 
At each step we do essentially the same calculation, namely
$$(t_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(t_i+\Delta t, y_i+\phi(t_i,y_i)\Delta t).$$
We expect that smaller time steps $\Delta t$ will give better
approximations, but of course it will require more work to compute to
a specified time. It is possible to compute a guaranteed upper bound
on how far off the approximation might be, that is, how far $\ds y_n$
is from $f(t_n)$. Suffice it to say that the bound is not particularly
good and that there are other more complicated approximation
techniques that do better.

\begin{example} Let us compute an approximation to the solution for $\ds\dot
y=t-y^2$, $y(0)=0$, when $t=1$. We will use $\Delta t=0.2$, which is
easy to do even by hand, though we should not expect the resulting
approximation to be very good. We get
$$\eqalign{
(t_1,y_1)&=(0+0.2,0+(0-0^2)0.2) = (0.2,0) \\
(t_2,y_2)&=(0.2+0.2,0+(0.2-0^2)0.2) = (0.4,0.04) \\
(t_3,y_3)&=(0.6,0.04+(0.4-0.04^2)0.2) = (0.6,0.11968) \\
(t_4,y_4)&=(0.8,0.11968+(0.6-0.11968^2)0.2) = (0.8,0.23681533952) \\
(t_5,y_5)&=(1.0,0.23681533952+(0.6-0.23681533952^2)0.2) = (1.0,0.385599038513605) \\}
$$
So $y(1)\approx 0.3856$. As it turns out, this is not accurate to
even one decimal place. Figure~\xrefn{fig:euler method vs rk} shows
these points connected by line segments (the lower curve) compared to
a solution obtained by a much better approximation technique. Note
that the shape is approximately correct even though the end points are
quite far apart.

It is easy to write a short function in Sage to do Euler's method; see

Euler's method is related to another technique that can help in
understanding a differential equation in a qualitative way. Euler's
method is based on the ability to compute the slope of a solution
curve at any point in the plane, simply by computing $\phi(t,y)$. If
we compute $\phi(t,y)$ at many points, say in a grid, and plot a small
line segment with that slope at the point, we can get an idea of how
solution curves must look. Such a plot is called a 
{\dfont slope field\index{slope field}}. A slope field for 
$\ds\phi=t-y^2$ is shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:slope field}; compare
this to figure~\xrefn{fig:euler method vs rk}.
With a little practice, one can sketch reasonably accurate solution
curves based on the slope field, in essence doing Euler's method
visually.

\figrdef{fig:slope field}
\endfigure{A slope field for $\ds\dot y=t-y^2$.}

Even when a differential equation can be solved explicitly, the slope
field can help in understanding what the solutions look like with
various initial conditions. Recall the logistic equation from
exercise~\xrefn{exer:logistic equation} in 
section~\xrefn{sec:first order differential equations}, $\ds\dot y =
ky(M-y)$: $y$ is a population at time $t$, $M$ is a measure of how
large a population the environment can support, and $k$ measures the
reproduction rate of the population.
Figure~\xrefn{fig:logistic slope field} shows a slope field
for this equation that is quite informative. 
It is apparent that if the initial population is smaller than $M$ it
rises to $M$ over the long term, while if the initial population is
greater than $M$ it decreases to $M$.
It is quite easy to
generate slope fields with Sage; follow the AP link in the figure caption.

\begin{exercises}

In problems 1--4, compute the Euler approximations for the initial
value problem for $0\le t\le 1$ and $\Delta t=0.2$. If you have access
to Sage, generate the slope field first and attempt to sketch the
solution curve. Then use Sage to compute better approximations with
smaller values of $\Delta t$.
