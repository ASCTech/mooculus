\section{Other Coordinate Systems}{}{}
\nobreak
Coordinate systems are tools that let us use algebraic methods to
understand geometry. While the {\dfont rectangular\index{rectangular
    coordinates}\index{coordinates!rectangular}\/} (also called
{\dfont Cartesian\index{Cartesian
    coordinates}\index{coordinates!Cartesian}\/}) coordinates that we
have been discussing are the most common, some problems are easier to
analyze in alternate coordinate systems.

A coordinate system is a scheme that allows us to identify any point
in the plane or in three-dimensional space by a set of numbers. In
rectangular coordinates these numbers are interpreted, roughly
speaking, as the lengths of the sides of a rectangular ``box.''

In two dimensions you may already be familiar with an alternative,
called {\dfont polar coordinates\index{polar
coordinates}\index{coordinates!polar}\/}. In this system, each
point in the plane is identified by a pair of numbers $(r,\theta)$.
The number $\theta$ measures the angle between the positive
$x$-axis and a vector with tail at the origin and head at the
point, as shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:polar coordinates}; the number
$r$ measures the distance from the origin to the
point. Either of these may be negative; a negative $\theta$ indicates
the angle is measured clockwise from the positive
$x$-axis instead of counter-clockwise, and a negative $r$ indicates
the point at distance $|r|$ in the opposite of the direction given by
$\theta$. 
Figure~\xrefn{fig:polar coordinates} also shows the point with
rectangular coordinates $\ds (1,\sqrt3)$ and polar coordinates 
$(2,\pi/3)$, 2 units from the origin and $\pi/3$ radians from the
positive $x$-axis.

We can extend polar coordinates to three dimensions simply by adding a
$z$ coordinate; this is called {\dfont cylindrical
coordinates\index{cylindrical coordinates}\index{coordinates!cylindrical}\/}.
Each point in three-dimensional space is represented by three
coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ in the obvious way: this point is $z$ units
above or below the point $(r,\theta)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane,
as shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:cylindrical coordinates}. The point
with rectangular coordinates $\ds (1,\sqrt3, 3)$ and cylindrical
coordinates $(2,\pi/3,3)$ is also indicated
in figure~\xrefn{fig:cylindrical coordinates}.

\endfigure{Cylindrical coordinates: the general case
and the point with rectangular coordinates $\ds (1,\sqrt3, 3)$.}

Some figures with relatively complicated equations in rectangular
coordinates will be represented by simpler equations in cylindrical
coordinates. For example, the cylinder in figure~\xrefn{fig:cylinder}
has equation $\ds x^2+y^2=4$ in rectangular coordinates, but equation
$r=2$ in cylindrical coordinates.

\figrdef{fig:cylinder}
\endfigure{The cylinder $r=2$.}

Given a point $(r,\theta)$ in polar coordinates, it is easy 
to see  (as in figure~\xrefn{fig:polar coordinates}) that
the rectangular coordinates of the same point are
$(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)$, and so the point $(r,\theta,z)$ in
cylindrical coordinates is $(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z)$ in
rectangular coordinates. This means it is usually easy to convert any
equation from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates: simply substitute
$$\eqalign{
  x&=r\cos\theta \\
  y&=r\sin\theta \\}
$$
and leave $z$ alone.
For example,
starting with $\ds x^2+y^2=4$ and substituting $x=r\cos\theta$,
$y=r\sin\theta$ gives 
$$\eqalign{
  r^2\cos^2\theta+r^2\sin^2\theta&=4 \\
  r^2(\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta)&=4 \\
  r^2&=4 \\
  r&=2. \\
}$$
Of course, it's easy to see directly that this defines a cylinder as
mentioned above.

Cylindrical coordinates are an obvious extension of polar coordinates
to three dimensions, but the use of the $z$ coordinate means they are
not as closely analogous to polar coordinates as another standard
coordinate system. In polar coordinates, we identify a point by a
direction and distance from the origin; in three dimensions we can do
the same thing, in a variety of ways. The question is: how do we
represent a direction? One way is to give the angle of rotation,
$\theta$, from the positive $x$ axis, just as in cylindrical
coordinates, and also an angle of rotation, $\phi$, from the positive
$z$ axis. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ is like longitude and $\phi$ is
like latitude. (Earth longitude is measured as a positive or negative
angle from the prime meridian, and is always between 0 and 180
degrees, east or west; $\theta$ can be any positive or negative angle,
and we use radians except in informal circumstances. 
Earth latitude is measured north or south
from the equator; $\phi$ is measured from the north pole down.) This
system is called {\dfont spherical coordinates\index{spherical
coordinates}\index{coordinates!spherical}\/}; 
the coordinates are listed in the order
$(\rho,\theta,\phi)$, where $\rho$ is the distance from the
origin, and like $r$ in cylindrical coordinates it may be negative. 
The general case and an
example are pictured in figure~\xrefn{fig:spherical coordinates}; the
length marked $r$ is the $r$ of cylindrical coordinates.

\endfigure{Spherical coordinates: the general case and the point 
with rectangular coordinates $\ds (1,\sqrt3 , 3)$.}

As with cylindrical coordinates, we can easily convert equations
in rectangular coordinates to the equivalent in spherical coordinates,
though it is a bit more difficult to discover the proper substitutions.
Figure~\xrefn{fig:rectangular to spherical coordinates} shows
the typical point in spherical coordinates from 
figure~\xrefn{fig:spherical coordinates},
viewed now so that the arrow marked $r$ in the original graph appears as
the horizontal ``axis'' in the left hand graph. From this diagram it
is easy to see that the $z$ coordinate is $\rho\cos\phi$, and that 
$r=\rho\sin\phi$, as shown. Thus, in converting from rectangular to
spherical coordinates we will replace $z$ by $\rho\cos\phi$. To see
the substitutions for $x$ and $y$ we now view the same point from
above, as shown in the right hand graph. The hypotenuse of the
triangle in the right hand graph
is $r=\rho\sin\phi$, so the sides of the triangle, as shown,
are $x=r\cos\theta=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta$ and 
$y=r\sin\theta=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta$. So the
upshot is that to convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates,
we make these substitutions:
$$\eqalign{
  x&=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta \\
  y&=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta \\
  z&=\rho\cos\phi. \\}
$$

As the cylinder had a simple equation in cylindrical coordinates, so
does the sphere in spherical coordinates: $\rho=2$ is the sphere of
radius 2. If we start with the
Cartesian equation of the sphere and substitute, we get the spherical
equation: 
$$\eqalign{
  x^2+y^2+z^2&=2^2 \\
  \rho^2\sin^2\phi\cos^2\theta+
     \rho^2\sin^2\phi\sin^2\theta+\rho^2\cos^2\phi&=2^2 \\
  \rho^2\sin^2\phi(\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta)+\rho^2\cos^2\phi&=2^2 \\
  \rho^2\sin^2\phi+\rho^2\cos^2\phi&=2^2 \\
  \rho^2(\sin^2\phi+\cos^2\phi)&=2^2 \\
