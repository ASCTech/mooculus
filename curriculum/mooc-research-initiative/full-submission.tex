\section{Proposal overview}

In January 2013, The Ohio State University (OSU) Mathematics
Department launched its first massive open online course (MOOC).  This
MOOC was designed to cover the same content as the local, in-person
sections of Math~1151, the first semester calculus course at OSU.  The
largest component of this MOOC consisted of a home-built adaptive
learning platform, called MOOCulus, which delivers randomly-generated
interactive problems to students.

\paragraph*{Large data set.} MOOCulus has already generated
significant amounts of data.  As of August~2013, there have been over
72k enrollments in the Coursera calculus courses and over 30k
subscriptions on iTunes~U.  These enrollments have led to millions of
attempts on homework exercises on MOOCulus.  Funding is sought to use
this large data set to evaluate the success of and to improve upon the
adaptive learning platform.

\paragraph*{Much more than calculus.} Although the proposed activity
considers adaptive learning through the lens of a specific course, the
platform and proposed activity benefits much more than a single course
or even a single department.  The home-built adaptive learning
platform has \textit{already} been used outside the math department:
specifically, pieces of MOOCulus were re-used for a English writing
course, called WexMOOC \parencite{gates-foundation-grant}.  The
American Languages Program at The Ohio State has also reached out to
use the adaptive learning platform to teach English grammar for their
ESL students.  

In short, an open-source adaptive learning platform, supported with
research on its effectiveness, is likely to be usable by many
disciplines.

\section{Literature}

Why focus then on calculus?  Calculus is the gateway to science,
technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) majors; unfortunately,
students abandon STEM majors because of the low quality of instruction
``with calculus often cited as a primary
reason'' \parencite{calculus-programs}.  Research universities are
``doing the worst job in maintaining student confidence in their
mathematical abilities, enjoyment of mathematics, and interest in
continuing with the mathematics that is needed to pursue their
intended careers'' \parencite{calculus-students}.  MOOCs---already
being used at some of the most prestigious US research
universities \parencite{morris2013moocs}---may provide a method by
which research universities can rein in costs and improve student
outcomes \parencite{bowen2013higher}.  In particular, there is
evidence that online assessment techniques can improve student
outcomes in math courses \parencite{angus2009does}.

\subsection{A platform for more than calculus}

For MOOCs to succeed, there must be ``customizable, sustainable
platforms'' \parencite{bowen2013higher} for online instruction;
MOOCulus, the home-built adaptive learning platform from The Ohio
State University, is such a platform for calculus
instruction \parencite{evans}, but parts of MOOCulus have also been
used for English courses \parencite{gates-foundation-grant}.  Indeed,
discipline-based education research is inherently interdisciplinary
\cite{dber-report}; in studying how best to teach calculus, there are
huge opportunities to think outside the traditional boundaries of the
mathematics department, and to apply the interdisciplinary toolkit of
educational data mining (EDM).  Educational data mining is a
relatively recent development, emerging out of a handful of workshops
from the early 00s; since 2008, there has been an annual EDM
conference organized by the International Working Group on Educational
Data Mining \parencite{WIDM:WIDM1075}.

\subsection{Deciding which student interactions should be logged}

Before launching a research project like MOOCulus---or any EDM
project---there is a serious prior choice to be made: exactly what
data will be mined?  What sorts of data will be stored on each student
interaction?  Such a decision, if made poorly, may seriously constrain
the usefulness of the research project.  Some systems have chosen to
record the date and time the student has engaged with various
educational applications \parencite{RomeroZaldivar20121058}; others
are looking at clickstream data \parencite{boyer2013student}.  Going
forward, it is worth considering a format for heterogeneous data
logging for student interaction, like the Tin Cap
API \parencite{tin-can-api}.  For the time being, MOOCulus logs the
data in the format similar to that of Khan Academy's exercise platform
\cite{khan-academy}, but there may be advantages to gathering data
from other sources, such as video views from within Coursera's
platform, or forum posts.

\subsection{Adaptive learning, in general}

Much work has been done on using adaptive learning systems to teach
college mathematics.  Examples of such are
ALEKS \parencite{hagerty2005using} or Knewton at Arizona
State \parencite{parry2012big}, though both of these emphasize
pre-calculus, developmental coursework.  What is an instructor to do?
For a calculus instructor---or for any instructor who would like to
customize an adaptive learning platform for his/her own course---it
can be very difficult to make use of an adaptive learning platform.

Some of these platforms use Bayesian networks to estimate a student's
current understanding \parencite{romero2010educational}.  Hidden
Markov models (HMMs) have also been used in educational data mining
for clustering
\parencite{shihdiscovery}.  These techniques and related ``machine
learning'' techniques can predict student grades based on only a few
assignments \parencite{predict-grades}, even with incomplete
data \parencite{Zafra201115020}, which make them especially useful for
an adaptive learning platform where not too much student data may be
available on which to base the initial predictions.

\subsection{Hidden Markov Models, in particular}

It is possible to apply a hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict student
retention in a MOOC; this was done, in particular, with edX's course
``CS169.1x---Software as a
Service'' \parencite{balakrishnan2013predicting}.  Hidden Markov
models can provide strong predictions of student behavior; in one
example, a hidden Markov model---trained, as in the proposed project,
via the Baum--Welch algorithm---did a better job of predicting student
behavior in an e-Learning context than did a neural
net \parencite{anari2012intelligent}.

The proposed project asks for more than predictions of student
behavior, however.  MOOCulus aims to use a hidden Markov model to
quantify student understanding.  There have been projects which use
hidden Markov models to gauge student performance in, for instance,
foreign language courses \parencite{khan2013automatic}; it will be
interesting to compare MOOCulus' HMM approach with the ``knowledge
spaces'' \parencite{albert1999knowledge} used by ALEKS.

\subsection{The parameter problem}

Parameter estimation is an extremely well-studied topic in the theory
of Markov processes, e.g., see \parencite{MR0202264,MR0123419}.
Before having access to student data, instructors often ``have to
provide appropriate values for the parameters in advance in order to
obtain good results/model and therefore, the user must possess a
certain amount of expertise in order to find the right
settings'' \parencite{romero2010educational}.  This is a serious
usability problem with many adaptive learning systems---MOOCulus
included (see Figure~\ref{fig:parameters}).

Determining appropriate values for these parameters is a usability
issue, and also one of the major research questions this proposed
project addresses.  Some work has been done in the direction of making
data mining easier for instructors. There are Java tools for analyzing
Moodle data which attempt to make educational data mining a bit easier
for the novice \parencite{java-data-mining}.  However, currently no
easy-to-use version of the Baum--Welch algorithm for EDM is available
to handle the training of a hidden Markov model; if the proposed
activity is funded, David Lindberg will be setting up the GHMM library
\parencite{ghmm} so improvements to the parameters can be made, say,
weekly just by re-running a few scripts.

\subsection{Empowering instructors with data analysis}

To verify that such adaptive methods are working, instructors need
easy methods to visualize student data.  David Bressoud---the
researcher behind the largest survey ever of calculus students---asks
the following \parencite{bressoud-sky-falling}:
\begin{quote}
  How can we modify our courses so as to capitalize on the strengths
  and correct the weaknesses that these students bring?  The answers
  to these questions will necessarily be local, highly dependent on
  the nature of a given college or university.
\end{quote}
The Ohio State University (OSU) Department of Mathematics has already
begun to look at these local, contextualized issues.  A pilot study of
``technology enhanced lectures'' at OSU showed significant improvement
in student opinion of the OSU Department of Mathematics, from 29\% of
students having a favorable opinion, to 80\% of students in the
technology-enhanced sections having a favorable opinion
\cite{miller-tech-enhanced-calculus}.  Such affective data can be an
even more important predictor than grades when considering STEM
retention: after all, 81\% of the ``switchers'' who left STEM
nevertheless received a grade of C or higher in their calculus course
\cite{calculus-programs}.

\section{Context of research}

\paragraph{Coursera and MOOCulus.}
Coursera was chosen as the MOOC provider; some assessments, like the
weekly quizzes, are done entirely within Coursera's platform, but
there are some limitations.  Most seriously, Coursera lacked an easy
method for producing randomly-generated problems, and so the team at
The Ohio State built their own MOOC platform to complement the missing
aspects of Coursera's assessment offerings.  This home-built MOOC
platform is called MOOCulus, and can be explored at
\[
\href{https://mooculus.osu.edu/}{\texttt{https://mooculus.osu.edu/}}
\]
using either a Coursera or Google login.  The platform is a Rails app
which uses Khan Academy's exercise framework \parencite{khan-academy}
for generating random instances of problems from an XML exercise
schema.  Steve Gubkin, a graduate student at OSU, has written 122
calculus exercises in this framework for the Calculus One
course \parencite{steve-gubkin}.

\paragraph{iTunes~U and MOOCulus.} The same content on Coursera is
also available on iTunes~U \parencite{itunesu}, which then also links
to MOOCulus.  The ability to deploy the ``same'' MOOC on multiple
platforms is a significant advantage of a home-built platform.

\paragraph{MOOCulus and data collection.} 
MOOCulus logs and timestamps all student input on homework exercises;
examples of such student input include requesting a ``hint'' or
obtaining a correct response on a first attempt (``ace'').  This
provides the researchers with a huge amount of data concerning student
interaction with MOOCulus.  To ensure FERPA compliance, the platform
runs in virtual machine instances entirely on OSU servers, and so not only do the researchers
have immediate access to the data, but they also have the ability to
modify and adapt what type of data is collected.

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
  \caption{Diagram of the MOOCulus hidden Markov model.}
\end{figure}

Once the MOOCulus data is collected, it is fed into a hidden Markov
model to produce an estimate (via the Viterbi algorithm) of the student's
understanding. Essentially, the students are assumed to be in one of
two states: ``knowing'' and ``unknowing.''  From the students'
performance on the exercises provided by MOOCulus, the hidden Markov
model estimates what state each student is most likely to be in.  For example, the time series data
$$
\mbox{correct},\quad\mbox{incorrect},\quad\mbox{correct},\quad\mbox{incorrect},\quad\mbox{correct},\quad\mbox{incorrect}
$$
is not strong evidence that the student is in the hidden ``knowing''
state.  On the other hand, time series data which would,
superficially, result in the same ``score'' of ``half right, half wrong,'' such as
$$
\mbox{incorrect},\quad\mbox{incorrect},\quad\mbox{incorrect},\quad\mbox{correct},\quad\mbox{correct},\quad\mbox{correct}
$$
is strong evidence of that the student has reached the ``knowing''
state by the end.  The order matters, and the HMM makes use of the order.

The student receives additional practice problems of the same sort
until it is estimated that their understanding reaches a threshold, at
which point the student is given a new type of exercise and the
process repeats.  The overall goal is to keep providing exercises that
are difficult enough to be fun and educational, but not so easy as to
become boring and repetitive.  In spite of the fact that many tens of
thousands of students used MOOCulus, each experienced a personalized
path through the material.  In short, MOOCulus promises to enable
MOOCs to be massive, but not mass-produced.

\subsection*{Personnel}

In addition to both building MOOCulus and running Calculus One, Fowler
and Snapp have experience using technology and analyzing its
effectiveness.  As part of the proposed activity, Lindberg will be
assisting Fowler and Snapp.

\paragraph*{Jim Fowler.} Fowler built the mobile phone
clicker used to measure student engagement for OSU's technology
enhanced calculus lectures, and Fowler's research training includes
high-dimensional data analysis from a topological perspective.  Tools from topological data analysis may prove useful when considering the MOOCulus data.

\paragraph*{Bart Snapp.} Having taught Calculus Remote at OSU (CROSU),
Snapp has also worked with OSU's Center for Enterprise Transformation
\& Innovation to build interactive textbooks for the iPad, with the
goal of measuring student engagement while reading the textbook.
Snapp is teaching two sections of calculus during Fall~2013 which will
be making heavy use of MOOCulus.

\paragraph*{David Lindberg.} A student in the masters of mathematical
sciences program specializing in mathematics education, Lindberg has
experience with data analysis and programming experience with R,
python, and ruby.  Lindberg is interested in working with Snapp on the
MOOCulus data; this proposal, if funded, would release Lindberg from
his teaching duties so as to work immediately on analyzing the data
from the first two iterations of MOOCulus, and considering the
research questions below on the adaptive learning platform that powers
MOOCulus.

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
  \caption{Fourteen parameters in the hidden Markov model; with five constraints, there are nine free parameters.}

  \label{fig:parameters}
\end{figure}

The hidden Markov model behind MOOCulus involves quite a few
parameters (see Figure~\ref{fig:parameters}).  In the current model, a
student is assumed to be either ``knowing'' or ``unknowing'' with some
prior probabilities which must sum to one, meaning $p_k + p_u = 1$; as
the student explores an exercise, they may change states---perhaps by
unlearning prior misconceptions (moving from ``unknowing'' to
``knowing'') or by developing new misconceptions (moving from
``knowing'' to ``unknowing'').  These transition probabilities need to
satisfy $t_{k,k} + t_{k,u} = t_{u,u} + t_{u,k} = 1$.  Whether knowing
or unknowing, the student may submit correct answers, incorrect
answers, request hints: the emission probabilities of doing so within
each hidden state must likewise sum to one, e.g.,
$k_{\mbox{\footnotesize ace}} + k_{\mbox{\footnotesize hint}} +
k_{\mbox{\footnotesize correct}} + k_{\mbox{\footnotesize
    incorrect}}=1$.  There are, therefore, nine free parameters for
each exercise to set by hand.  Since the visible emissions depend on
the hidden state, there is hope to recover information about the
hidden state by considering the visible emissions.

Choosing the appropriate values for the nine parameters in order to achieve an accurate model of
student understanding takes a great deal of instructor intervention
and skill \parencite{romero2010educational}; can this be automated?
Can hand-chosen parameters be justified?

Student data provides a method for doing precisely this.  As students
interact with MOOCulus, the data needed to refine the parameters of
the hidden Markov model is obtained.  Specifically, under the proposed
activity, the Baum--Welch algorithm would be used to set those
parameters.

Many of the parameters are pedagogically meaningful.  To what degree
is a correct answer after three ``hints'' strong evidence of student
understanding?  What prior probability should be assigned to the
likelihood of a student to submit a correct answer on the first try?
The best parameters depend strongly on the particular homework exercise;
some exercises are conceptually deep but procedurally easy, while some
questions are conceptually light but procedurally quite involved, so
even a strong student may make ``careless'' mistakes which the model
shouldn't count against him/her on those procedurally involved
exercises.  The hand-chosen parameters appear to work ``well enough''
in practice, but the analysis of the data is required to justify the
hand-chosen parameters, and refinement may improve the student
experience. This leads to three basic questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item What parameters in the adaptive learning model best align online
  student performance with in-class student performance?
\item To what extent does student use of adaptive learning correlate
  with success in traditional, in-person courses?
\item Should the proposed model of student performance (i.e., two
  categories) be refined into additional categories?
\end{itemize}
The former question addresses improving the hidden Markov model that
powers MOOCulus; the second question gets deeper, by addressing the
extent to which adaptive learning helps with in-person courses.

These questions, though framed in the setting of a calculus class, are
quite general; discipline specific education research is
inherently interdisciplinary \cite{dber-report}.  The MOOCulus
platform has already been used in the aforementioned English writing
MOOC---the so-called WexMOOC \parencite{gates-foundation-grant}; there
has been interest from other departments on campus and from the Office
of Distance Education at OSU.  These research questions, and the
resulting improvements to an open-source adaptive learning platform,
would be of interest to both education researchers and educators
alike, regardless of their chosen content area or specialty of
expertise.

\section{Data sources}

A large data set already exists from the first run of the Calculus One
MOOC in Spring 2013; with a total enrollment of 47k~students, the
course still had 11,000 students engaging with the material after four
weeks, and 2,000 students at Week~15.  Altogether, a total of
2,079,428 correct answers were submitted to MOOCulus, with a total of
10.3 person-years having been spent by students working problems.  The
activity logs are stored in a SQL database and this database has been
imported for analysis into R, though very little data analysis has
been done to date.

A second iteration of the Calculus One MOOC has been started at OSU
for Fall 2013.  There are already 25k students enrolled in that second
run.  In addition, Snapp is teaching two on-campus calculus courses: a
course for engineers and a course for teachers.  Fowler and Snapp have
obtained a letter of final determination from the Institutional Review
Board facilitating the use of human subjects in our research.  The
proposed plan is to have each of these groups of students enroll in
MOOCulus so that we can directly compare students' performance in the
online course with their in-class performance.

\section{Methodology}

\paragraph{Hidden Markov parameters.}

The data will be analyzed in R.  The Baum--Welch algorithm will be
used to set the parameters in the hidden Markov model. This will allow
the parameters in the MOOCulus hidden Markov model to be set for each
problem separately.  These parameters are independently of interest to
researchers, and they also will provide for a better student
experience for MOOCulus in Spring 2014.  

\paragraph{Correlation to success.}

To assess the correlation between success in the MOOC and success in
the traditional course, in addition to teaching the online MOOC, Snapp
is teaching calculus to two---quite different---student populations in
Fall 2013.  The first is a calculus course for middle school teachers
($n=28$). In this course, students will complete online assignments on
MOOCulus as part of their grade.  The second is a calculus course for
engineering students ($n\approx 200$).  In this course, students will
be encouraged to work online problems in MOOCulus, but there will be
no grade attached to their progress.  By involving his in-person
students also in the online MOOCulus course, the extent to which
participation in the adaptive learning system correlates with success
on in-person assessments can be determined.


\section{Budget needs}

A course buyout provides necessary time for Snapp to perform the data
analysis, to write up the results, and to oversee the analysis work of
a graduate student (Lindberg).  One course buyout for Snapp is 15\% of
the combination of his base salary (\$60132) plus 29.6\% in
benefits. For Spring 2013, this amounts to $.15 \cdot 1.296\cdot
60132=\$11690$.  To release Lindberg from his teaching further costs
\$1925/month plus 12.6\% in benefits; for the Spring Semester from
January--May, this costs $\$1925 \cdot 5 \cdot 1.126 = \$10838$.
Altogether, the total cost for the two researchers' time is \$22528.

For dissemination, a proposed venue is the
EDM2014, which has the appropriate theme of ``Big Data'' \parencite{edm-2014}.  A
round-trip economy flight on a US~Flag carrier for Snapp and Lindberg
is estimated to cost \$1211.  Shared lodging is estimated to cost
\$990.  Altogether, \$2201 is therefore budgeted for conference
travel, meaning the total budget is \$24729 for the proposed
activities.
