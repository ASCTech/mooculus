            <h1>Calculus One</h1>
	    <p>Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things change&mdash;the surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world.</p>
	    <p>This course is a first and friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems.  One learns calculus by doing calculus, and so this course is based around <a href="/exercises">doing practice problems</a>.
