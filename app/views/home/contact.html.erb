<h3>Questions?</h3>

<p>The fastest way to get a response is to <a href="https://class.coursera.org/calc1-002/forum/index">post a message on the course forum</a>; all of the <a href="/developers">teaching and technical staff</a> spend time there and are ready to answer your questions quickly.</p>

<!--<p>If you have a math question which you'd like to see addressed in a future lecture video, click on the &ldquo;Call Me&rdquo; widget on the right hand side; this connects you to the Calculus One voicemail helpline, where you can record your question after the beep.</p>-->

<!--<p>The head instructor of this course is <a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~fowler/">Jim Fowler</a>; if you have private comments and don't need an answer quickly, you can send email to him at <a href="mailto:fowler@math.osu.edu">fowler@math.osu.edu</a>.</p>
